# early-detection-of-forest-fires

## Problem Statement

The forest fire dataset from UCI machine learning repository contains area of forest fire and used
to predict the same. This dataset is further modified by adding a forest fire indicator variable along
with the weather data[2]. Most of the fire management agencies use six components that account
for the effects of fuel moisture and weather conditions on fire behaviour[3]. These codes represent
numeric ratings of moisture content of forest and floor, spread of fire, combustibility of fuels available
in forest. All of these codes are derived from meteorological readings namely temperature, relative
humidity(RH), wind speed and precipitation.

The main objective being building a system to predict the forest fire incidents in advance using
the past data, multiple analysis have to be carried out to understand data, select important features,
create new features if necessary to capture past effects. Main challenge in this task is dealing the
limited data and performing feature engineering while keeping in mind the ultimate step to output
a generalized model.
